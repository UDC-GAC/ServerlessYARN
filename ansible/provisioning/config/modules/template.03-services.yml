## TODO: add the node scaler (ServerlessContainers) and eve server (BDWatchdog) ports
# Both currently use port 8000, which causes a conflict when using the server as host (due to the deployment of a node scaler on the server)
# To fix this, it is required to remove the hardcoded ports in the code of SC and BDW and set them dynamically

## Data server
# Local data server to provide files to containers on demand
# Access data server from withing containers using DATA_SERVER_IP and DATA_SERVER_PORT environment variables
local_data_server: no # "yes" to deploy the local data server
